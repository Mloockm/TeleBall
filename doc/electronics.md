Download TeleBall's [detailed Schematics PDF](eagle/BreakOut-8x8-rev2-circuit.pdf). The subfolder
`eagle` of your TeleBall package contains all schematics including the PCB design. We
used the Freeware version of the specialized CAD software [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/)
to create the schematics and the board layout (PCB design).

### The Circuit Explained

The following parts are the main parts of the circuit:

* Microcontroller: 5V version of Arduino Nano 3.0 or compatible device ([Data Sheet](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano))
* 8x8 LED Display: KWM-R30881CBB aka AdaFruit 1817 ([Data Sheet](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/1047datasheet.pdf))
* LED Display Driver: MAX7221 ([Data Sheet](http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX7219-MAX7221.pdf))
* Radio: nRF24L01+ on an Arduino friendly breakout board ([Data Sheet](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/content/download/2726/34069/file/nRF24L01P_Product_Specification_1_0.pdf))
* Voltage Regulator: Rohm BD33KA5FP-E2 ([Data Sheet](http://rohmfs.rohm.com/en/products/databook/datasheet/ic/power/linear_regulator/bdxxka5-e.pdf))

Some basics about how these main parts work together:

* The Arduino is the heart of TeleBall. Using its Harvard architecture, we are able to store
  the program code itself on (32kB Flash) as well as configuration data (1kB EEPROM). Additionally, it
  features SRAM (2kB). The built-in USB port in conjunction with Arduino's bootloader
  allows us to update TeleBall's firmware easily. The Arduino has a built-in current
  regulation, so we can directly connect it to UB+.

* As each pin of the Arduino is able to supply 40mA, the Arduino can directly drive the
  three status LEDs and the speaker. Pin D9 is a PWM (Pulse-width modulation) capable pin;
  this is important to generate tones via software.

* The 8x8 LED matrix has 64 LEDs but only 16 pins. That means, that you need to scan through
  the matrix (either line by line or column by column) very quickly to control it pixelwise.
  The MAX7221 is doing this automatically, so the Arduino just needs to transmit the desired
  pattern. This is done using the digital output pins D2, D3 and D4, that communicate via the
  SPI protocol with the MAX7221 display driver.

* The Led Matrix Driver MAX7221 is not only controlling the 8x8 LED matrix but also
  driving it by supplying voltage and current for the actual operation of the LEDs. The MAX7221
  allows up to 6V voltage at its VCC pin. We are therefore directly connecting it to the
  battery current UB+, which is initially - as long as the batteries are new/full - indeed 6V
  but dropping during the lifetime of the batteries.

* The wiring of the MAX7221 to the 8x8 LED matrix might look a bit weird: This is mainly
  because of the inner workings of the LED matrix, that is internally not wired linearly.
  For example, as described in the [Data Sheet](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/1047datasheet.pdf),
  LED row #1 is mapped to pin #9 and LED column #2 to pin #3. The MAX7221 is supplying
  current at SEG DP, SEG A .. SEG G and sinking current from the display's common
  cathode at DIG 0 .. DIG 7. 

* The radio is able to cope with 5V control lines, i.e. Arduino's digital outputs
  MOSI, MISO, SCK, IRQ, CSN, CE but it cannot be driven by 5V. This is why we use the
  Rohm voltage regulator that converts the up to 6V UB+ to a stable 3.3V. The names of the
  signal lines MOSI/MISO/etc. might be misleading a bit: The whole radio SPI control is done
  in software, we are not using any hardware SPI features and therefore we *could* have
  wired the radio differently, when it comes to digital ports at the Arduino.

* We used high intensity LEDs, this is why the series resistors R5, R6, R7 are having
  such high Ohm values. If you plan to use normal / weaker LEDs, then you could use
  1kΩ resistors instead.

* The software activates the internal pull-up resistor of  the digital input D8 and
  uses an inverse logic. Therefore it expects a button that also uses reverse / inverse
  logic, i.e. no current when pressed and current when not pressed.

* TeleBall's main game control, the "paddle" or "knob", is implemented using a
  10kΩ potentiometer that connects with the Arduino's 10bit-A/D analog input A7.
  (Note, that TeleBall's firmware configures the other Ax analog pins, particularly
  A0, A1 and A2 as digital outputs.)

Important Files
---------------

All files related to TeleBall's electronics are [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/)
files, so you find them in the `eagle` folder.

    BreakOut-8x8-rev2.sch      Eagle schematics file. The above-mentioned
                               schematics are contained here.
    BreakOut-8x8-rev2.brd      Eagle PCB layout file. The below-mentioned
                               board layouts are contained here.
    libraries.zip              As the .sch and .brd files are self-contained,
                               you only need the Eagle libraries from the ZIP,
                               if you want to dig deeper, e.g. modify details
                               of parts.

Custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
----------------------------------

To get a custom PCB you just need to send the file `BreakOut-8x8-rev2.brd` from the
`eagle` folder of the TeleBall package to the online PCB manufacturer of your choice.
The `.brd` file contains the multiple layers of which your PCB is consisting of:

{% include gallery_show.html images=page.pcb_schematics group=2 %}

And this is how the result, i.e. the custom manufactured PCB should basically look like:  

{% include gallery_show.html images=page.pcb_image group=2 %}

The left side shows the top side of the PCB, the gap at the top right is for the
red button, the so called Universal Button (reset, configuration, confirmation, etc).

### Some Hints for Assembling and Soldering TeleBall

* You might want to print out the above-mentioned high-resolution versions of the
  graphical assembly diagrams. Additionally, the high-resolution PDFs of the board
  schematics might be useful, too:
  [Top Layer Schematics](eagle/BreakOut-8x8-rev2-board2-top.pdf) and
  [Bottom Layer Schematics](eagle/BreakOut-8x8-rev2-board3-bottom.pdf)

* How to solder the SMD parts (like the capacitors Cx or the resistors Rx):
  Tin-coat one pad; while the tin-solder is still liquid, use a pair of
  tweezers to place the SMD part; as the tin-solder cools down, the SMD part
  starts to sit firm; now heat the second pad and let the tin-solder flow
  below the SMD part; let it cool down again; done.

* Solder all SMD parts (top and bottom side of the PCB) first, including the
  voltage regulator (IC2 VREG3). Then go on with MAX7221 (IC1). Then do
  the on/off switch (SCHALTER) and after that the LEDs and the cables for
  the speaker (LS+ and LS-) as well as the cables for the potentiometer.
  Only then, solder the Arduino (MODUL1 ARDUINO) and the radio breakout
  board (SV1). The reason for this suggested soldering order is, that
  some of the larger parts like the Arduino and the radio breakout board
  are hiding some of the smaller parts and some of the cables.

* You need to cut the legs of the ICs after you soldered them. Cut the
  Arduino Nano "head" pins before soldering it (they would interfere
  with the speaker if not cut).

* Before you marry the PCB and the case as described in the next bullet
  point, be sure that you added the battery clips before (see next section).  

* The 8x8 LED matrix is the last part of TeleBall that you solder: Insert it
  through the case's front side (there are dedicated holes for that) while
  holding the PCB against the inside of the case. While doing so, you are
  basically filtering in the 8x8 LED matrix through the case as well as
  through the PCB and therefore, this action "glues" both elements together.

* Be mindful about the length of the cables. We advise to use red cables
  for +, black cables for - and other colors for signal cables. Additionally,
  we recommend to strip the insulaton at the cable ends and to tin-coat them.

### Battery Clips

The case as well as the lid feature special places where the battery clips /
battery springs need to be added. As shown in the image below, there
are two kinds of battery clips: Flat clips and clips with springs.
We bought just one variant - with springs -  and created the other kind by
cutting off the spring.There is a different treatment of the battery clips
in the case versus the battery clips in the lid:

* Case: If you look at the back side of the case with the open facing side
  down and the side which will hold the on/off switch and the USB port
  facing up, then after inserting the battery clips on the top/right and
  top/left side, you should solder a red wire at the right clip. After the
  marriage of the PCB and the case, you would solder the red wire to
  the BAT+ pad on the PCB. Furtheron you should solder a black wire at
  the left clip and later, after the marriage, solder it to the BAT- pad.
  The top right clip is without a spring and the top left clip is with a spring.

* Lid: As shown in the image below, insert two battery clips into the lid
  and connect both with a wire. Be mindful not to have two springs at the
  same side, i.e. if you followed the above-mentioned instructions about
  the springs, then you should place the clip with a spring in the lid just
  as shown in the image below.

Some hints about "Where to get it":

* As the world of electronics is very fast paced, it might be that some of the
  sources mentioned here will not be active any more when you visit this page.
  Please inform us via email: sy2002 at teleball.org, if you discover that.

* The term "Standard / Farnell: <number>" means: This is a pretty standard part;
  you should get it "everywhere", i.e. enter the part name in google. Additionally
  we supply a Farnell part <number> in this cases. Farnell is a very international
  distributor so it is very likely, that it is available in your country, too.
  Head to www.farnell.com and copy/paste the into Farnell's search bar.

* You can also use [www.findchips.com](http://www.findchips.com) to find vendors
  for the parts.

* In general: If you cannot find a certain part at all, it might make sense 
  to search for a similar alternative from another vendor. The drawback in this
  case might be, that the case might need some small adjustments.
